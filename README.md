# D FLIP FLOP USING CMOSD FLIP FLOP USING CMOS
This project simulates the designed D Flip Flop using CMOS circuit to determine its performance characteristics pre layout and post layout
# A Glance at the D Flip Flop IP
CMOS D flip flops are first preference to implement different type of binary counters, shift registers and analog and digital circuit system.The TSPC logic which allows to represent the design of D flip flop with smaller area and lower power consumption as compared to master-slave configuration based D flip flop.Delay flip flops stores whatever input pattern in its D input. So it is helpful to process the data bit by bit to get solutions for complex functions. It is known as Data flip flop since it can store data.
